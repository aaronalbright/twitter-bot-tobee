# Tobee the Twitter Bot
> Because everything is going Tobee alright.

Tobee is an insanely simple Python-built Twitter bot designed to encourage.

I'm not sure if a Python script can actually help someone going through a rough time via Twitter.

But Tobee will certainly try.

## Current Issues
* Unfortunately, Tobee is only able to respond to his most-recent mention. On a slow day, he's able to handle most cries for help, but any more than two tweets in a 60-second period and Toby gets confused.

* He only runs locally right now. (This is intentional)

* When Tobee can handle as many mentions thrown at him at once, he'll be ready for a full Heroku deployment.
